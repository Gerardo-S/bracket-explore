Gatsby is a React-based framework decoupling content and development workflows through the use of its data layer technology known as GraphQL. GraphQl allows developers to query for the data you need all in one place. See gatsby docs at <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/</a> for more information.
